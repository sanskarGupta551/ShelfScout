- **SLA Management:** Objective measurement of service quality

### 3. Cost Optimization
**Goal:** Reduce operational costs while maintaining performance

#### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Implement budget controls and alerts at project and service levels
- [ ] Configure resource scheduling:
  - Scale down prediction endpoints during off-hours (10 PM - 6 AM)
  - Use spot VMs for non-critical batch processing
- [ ] Optimize storage with lifecycle policies:
  - Archive older training data to coldline storage
  - Set retention policies for logs and intermediate artifacts
- [ ] Implement cost allocation tags for component-level tracking
- [ ] Create cost optimization dashboard with trend analysis
- [ ] Evaluate reserved resource commitments for stable workloads

#### Expected Benefits
- **Cost Reduction:** Target 30-40% reduction in monthly operational costs
- **Budget Predictability:** Better forecasting of resource expenditure
- **Resource Efficiency:** Eliminate wasted capacity
- **Cost Accountability:** Attribution of costs to specific components

### 4. Extended User Interface
**Goal:** Enhance the ShelfScout platform with additional user-facing capabilities

#### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Develop admin portal for ML operations:
  - Model deployment controls
  - A/B test configuration
  - Performance monitoring visualizations
- [ ] Create business intelligence dashboard:
  - Product detection statistics by category
  - Planogram compliance reporting
  - Historical trend analysis
  - Out-of-stock detection alerts
- [ ] Implement user management and access control
- [ ] Add customizable report generation and export
- [ ] Create API usage monitoring and throttling controls

#### Expected Benefits
- **User Empowerment:** Self-service capabilities for business users
- **Operational Efficiency:** Reduced need for direct ML engineering involvement
- **Business Insights:** Actionable retail intelligence from detection data
- **Platform Growth:** Foundation for additional service offerings

### 5. Security Enhancements
**Goal:** Strengthen security posture and compliance controls

#### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Implement VPC Service Controls:
  - Create service perimeter around ML resources
  - Configure access levels based on IP ranges and identity
- [ ] Enhance secret management:
  - Migrate API keys to Secret Manager
  - Implement automatic rotation policies
- [ ] Configure regular vulnerability scanning:
  - Container image scanning in CI/CD pipeline
  - Dependency analysis for security issues
- [ ] Implement data protection measures:
  - Integration with Data Loss Prevention API for PII detection
  - Automated data anonymization where appropriate
- [ ] Create security audit logging and reporting

#### Expected Benefits
- **Risk Reduction:** Minimized attack surface and vulnerability exposure
- **Compliance:** Better alignment with security frameworks and requirements
- **Data Protection:** Enhanced safeguards for sensitive information
- **Threat Detection:** Earlier identification of potential security issues
