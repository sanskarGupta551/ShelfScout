# ShelfScout: Data Preprocessing and Augmentation

## Data Format Conversion
- Successfully converted SKU-110K dataset to TFRecord format for efficient training
- Implemented robust error handling to manage invalid images and annotations
- Created coordinate conversion utilities for consistent normalization
- Generated properly structured TFRecord examples compatible with TensorFlow Object Detection API
- Added centralized validation to ensure all coordinates remain in [0,1] range

## Data Augmentation Implementation
- Developed comprehensive augmentation pipeline with 10+ techniques:
  - **Color adjustments**: Brightness (0.6-1.4), contrast (0.6-1.4), hue (-0.15-0.15), saturation (0.6-1.4)
  - **Geometric transformations**: Horizontal flip, rotation (-15° to 15°), random crop (0.7-1.0 ratio)
  - **Advanced techniques**: Intelligent cutout with overlap minimization, 4-image mosaic (900×900px)
  - **Combined augmentations**: 7 specialized augmentation pairs for enhanced diversity
- Created intelligent smart sampling strategy to select 3-4 augmentations per image
- Implemented occlusion handling with 70% visibility threshold for cutout regions
- Developed proper coordinate transformation for all geometric augmentations

## Memory Optimization
- Reduced batch size to 25 for optimal memory management
- Added explicit garbage collection after each batch processing
- Implemented figure memory management with plt.close() calls
- Created pre-selection mechanism to avoid unnecessary augmentation generation
- Optimized cutout placement to minimize overlap with existing objects
- Replaced parallel processing with sequential approach to avoid resource issues

## Dataset Generation
- Created single consolidated TFRecord containing ~30,000-35,000 augmented examples
- Generated supporting files including label_map.pbtxt and dataset_info.json
- Implemented comprehensive dataset statistics tracking
- Created visualization functions for dataset verification
- Successfully uploaded processed data to Cloud Storage for training use

## Process Validation
- Developed TFRecord validation function to confirm data integrity
- Added visualization capabilities to review augmentation quality
- Implemented detailed logging for error tracking and diagnosis
- Created comprehensive augmentation statistics reporting
- Added annotation quality verification for all augmentation types
