# ShelfScout: Week 1 Implementation Report

## Week 1: Project Setup & Data Preparation
**Status: COMPLETED**

This document outlines the completed implementation of Week 1 tasks for the ShelfScout project, covering project setup, data infrastructure, and preprocessing pipeline development.

## 1. Project Setup

  - Vertex AI API
  - Cloud Storage API
  - BigQuery API
  - Notebooks API
  - Cloud Build API
  - Container Registry API

### IAM Configuration

## 3. Dataset Preparation

### Dataset Acquisition
- Downloaded SKU-110K dataset
- Dataset specs: 11,762 retail shelf images with ~1.7 million annotated product bounding boxes
- Average of 147 objects per image

### Dataset Structure
The dataset was uploaded to GCS with the following structure:
```
SKU110K_Kaggle/
├── images/
│   ├── train/
│   ├── val/
│   └── test/
└── labels/
    ├── train/
    ├── val/
    └── test/
```

## 4. Data Analysis

A comprehensive data analysis was performed to understand the dataset characteristics. Key findings include:

### Data Distribution
- Train split: 8,185 images (70%)
- Validation split: 584 images (5%)
- Test split: 2,920 images (25%)

### Image Properties
- Average resolution: 675×826 pixels
- Aspect ratio range: 0.7-1.5 (primarily portrait orientation)
- High variety of lighting conditions and angles

### Annotation Analysis
- Average of 147 objects per image
- High object density (products tightly packed on shelves)
- Small object size (most products occupy <5% of image area)
- Single class ("product")

## 5. Vertex AI Dataset Configuration

### Dataset Registration
- Created a central Vertex AI dataset registration pointing to the GCS bucket
- Applied rich metadata with dataset characteristics
- Stored extended metadata in separate JSON file for reference

### Implementation Details
```python
# Simplified Vertex AI dataset creation
dataset = aiplatform.ImageDataset.create(
    display_name="SKU110K-Dataset",
    gcs_source=f"gs://{BUCKET_NAME}/SKU110K_Kaggle",
    import_schema_uri=aiplatform.schema.dataset.ioformat.image.bounding_box,
    sync=True
)

# Add metadata to the dataset
dataset.update(
    labels={
        "purpose": "retail_object_detection",
        "project": "shelfscout",
        "dataset_name": "sku110k",
        "version": "1_0",
        "splits": "train_val_test",
        "train_count": str(train_count),
        "val_count": str(val_count),
        "test_count": str(test_count),
        "total_images": str(total_count)
    }
)
```

## 6. Data Preprocessing Pipeline

A comprehensive production-ready preprocessing pipeline was implemented as both a notebook and Python script.

### Preprocessing Steps
1. **Image Standardization**:
   - Resize all images to 640×640 pixels
   - Maintain aspect ratio with padding
   - Convert to RGB format if needed

2. **Pixel Normalization**:
   - Scale pixel values from [0-255] to [0-1] range

3. **Annotation Transformation**:
   - Convert bounding box coordinates to match resized images
   - Maintain normalized format (0-1 range)

4. **TFRecord Generation**:
   - Organized into train/val/test splits
   - Sharded for efficient data loading (10 shards for train, 5 each for val/test)
   - Complete TensorFlow Example format with all required fields

### Implementation Highlights
```python
# Core preprocessing function
def preprocess_and_create_tfrecord(split, num_shards=10):
    """
    Preprocess images and create TFRecords for the given split
    """
    # Create output path
    output_dir = f"{OUTPUT_PATH}/{split}"
    bucket.blob(f"{output_dir}/").upload_from_string('')
    
    # List images
    image_blobs = list(bucket.list_blobs(prefix=f"{INPUT_PATH}/images/{split}/"))
    image_blobs = [blob for blob in image_blobs if blob.name.lower().endswith(('.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png'))]
    num_images = len(image_blobs)
    
    # Calculate sharding
    images_per_shard = int(np.ceil(num_images / num_shards))
    
    # Process each shard
    for shard_id in range(num_shards):
        # Process images in this shard
        with tf.io.TFRecordWriter(output_file) as writer:
            # Process each image
            for idx in range(start_idx, end_idx):
                # Read image and annotation
                # Resize image to TARGET_SIZE
                # Normalize pixel values
                # Scale bounding boxes
                # Create and write TF Example
        
        # Upload to GCS
        bucket.blob(f"{output_dir}/{output_file}").upload_from_filename(output_file)
```

### Production-Ready Script
The preprocessing pipeline was also packaged as a standalone Python script with:
- Command-line arguments for flexible configuration
- Proper error handling and logging
- Progress tracking and statistics
- Verification capabilities

## 7. Output Verification

The preprocessing pipeline was verified to ensure quality:

### Verification Process
- Sampled TFRecord files from each split
- Visualized processed images with bounding boxes
- Confirmed image dimensions and normalization
- Validated annotation transformations

### Verification Results
- All images properly resized to 640×640 pixels
- Annotations correctly transformed to match resized images
- TFRecord structure follows TensorFlow Object Detection API requirements
- Verification images show accurate object detection boxes

### Statistics
```
VERIFICATION SUMMARY:

TRAIN SPLIT:
  TFRecord files: 10
  Examples in sampled file: 819
  Image dimensions: ['640x640']
  Objects per image: [173, 63]

VAL SPLIT:
  TFRecord files: 5
  Examples in sampled file: 116
  Image dimensions: ['640x640']
  Objects per image: [119, 163]

TEST SPLIT:

  Examples in sampled file: 584
  Image dimensions: ['640x640']
  Objects per image: [120, 198]
```

## 8. Data Management Strategy

The project now has two complementary data assets:

1. **Vertex AI Dataset**: 
   - Managed reference to raw data
   - Rich metadata and tracking
   - Accessible through Vertex AI console

2. **Preprocessed TFRecords**:
   - Optimized for model training
   - Consistent preprocessing applied
   - Ready for Week 2 model development

2. Set up Vertex AI Experiments for tracking model iterations
3. Train initial AutoML Vision model for object detection
4. Evaluate baseline model performance on the test set

## Conclusion
