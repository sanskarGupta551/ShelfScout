## Key Milestones
1. **End of Week 2:** Working baseline model deployed
2. **End of Week 5:** Complete MLOps pipeline with custom model
3. **End of Week 7:** Fully functional web application at shelfscout.cloudaiprojects.com
4. **End of Week 10:** Production-ready system with monitoring

## Technical Dependencies
- GCP project with billing enabled and appropriate quotas
- Access to GPU/TPU resources for training
- Domain configuration for shelfscout.cloudaiprojects.com
- SKU-110K dataset properly licensed for commercial use

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Data Quality Issues:**
   - Early validation of SKU-110K dataset
   - Fallback plan to use AutoML if custom model challenges emerge

2. **Performance Bottlenecks:**
   - Regular benchmark testing throughout development
   - Staged rollout to identify scaling issues early

3. **Integration Challenges:**
   - Weekly end-to-end testing of the entire pipeline
   - Modular architecture to isolate and address specific issues

4. **Resource Constraints:**
   - Reservation of GPU/TPU resources in advance
   - Cost monitoring and optimization throughout development

## Success Criteria
- Model accuracy exceeds 90% mAP on test dataset
- Inference latency below 200ms per image
- Web application loads in under 2 seconds
- End-to-end pipeline executes reliably with proper error handling
- Monitoring provides clear visibility into system performance

This implementation plan creates a structured approach to building ShelfScout while emphasizing MLOps best practices and highlighting professional ML engineering capabilities throughout the development lifecycle.
